I use [plan9port][p9p] and a web browser for most of my time on a
computer, both at work on my Macbook and at home on my desktop
running [Elementary OS][elementary]. The [Plan 9][plan9] userspace
is wonderful. When you have such a composable, complementary set
of tools, it is pretty amazing what you *don't* need.
